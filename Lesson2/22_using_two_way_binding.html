  <title>Lesson 2 - Using two way binding</title>
</head>

  <!--
    Two way data binding:
    We want to output data and in the same time
    update the data.
    All we have to do in this direction is to use the v-model directive
    in respect to the data property. This will tell Vue to set two way
    data binding for this data property. And, in one hand, it will output
    the value as well as listen to changes and update it.

    <input type="text" v-model="name">
    <p>{{ name }}</p>
