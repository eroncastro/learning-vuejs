    How to select an element from the DOM using VueJS framework?
    In Vanilla JS, we would use a query selector.
    In VueJS it is possible to place a ref key on the HTML element.
    IMPORTANT: it is not an HTML key; it was introduced by VueJS.
    "ref" is a key recognized by VueJS that can be placed in every element
    controlled by it and that may have any name we choose.
