  <title>Lesson 2 - Modifying an event with event modifiers</title>

      Suppose we don't want anything to happen while moving the mouse over
      the 'dead spot' span element bellow. What we could do is setting a dummy
      method on it and then use event.stopPropagation() not to let it propagate
      to elements that might hold it.

      A fancier solution is to use a modifier that will not execute anything.
      A modifier is placed after the event name with a dot (.). Bellow, we use
      the stop modifier. It is also possible to chain modifiers.
